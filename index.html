    Hello, my name is Tiana Douze,
    and I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.
    I am currently in the final stretch of my academic journey,
    completing my last semester at BMCC,
    where I am majoring in Digital Marketing.
    I have a deep love for animals and I am a proud dog owner.
    I have two wonderful dogs who bring so much joy into my life.
    When I am not busy with school or caring for my dogs,
    I love to unwind by indulging in one of my favorite activities, coloring.
    It is an activity that not only helps me relax but
    also allows me to express my creativity in a different way.
