    Hello, my name is Tiana Douze,
    and I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.
    I’m currently in the final stretch of my academic journey,
    completing my last semester at BMCC,
    where I’m majoring in Digital Marketing.
    I have a deep love for animals and am a proud dog owner.
    I have two wonderful dogs who bring so much joy into my life.
    When I’m not busy with school or caring for my dogs,
    I love to unwind by indulging in one of my favorite activities, coloring.
    It’s an activity that not only helps me relax but
    also allows me to express my creativity in a different way.
